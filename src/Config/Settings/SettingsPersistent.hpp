/*
Reflection based serializer limitations:

 - C style arrays are unsupported so no "char foo[32]" for example
 - std::array arrays or std::vectors however do work with basic types (aggregate types are untested)
 - Data types like std::tuple or ordered map are unsupported (others are untested)
 - Nested structs are supported as long as these also are put through the TOML_SERIALIZABLE() macro.
 - Structs can only contain a total of 64 unique entries, this is a limitation of the reflect library.
   In order to be able to have > 64 the visit template in the reflect library needs to be expanded.
 - Enums are also unsupported. They can however be saved as either int or string. Its better to save them as a string though
   and use something like magic_enum to do the conversion between string <-> enum.

/* Naming Convention
* i(x) -> integer(Ammount of elements if array)
* f(x) -> float(Ammount of elements if array)
* b(x) -> bool(Ammount of elements if array)
* s(x) -> string(Ammount of elements if array)
* stucts don't get a special notation
